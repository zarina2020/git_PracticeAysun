During those 10 years, Git itself has taken the world by a storm, and the most popular type of
software that is being developed with Git is shifting more towards web apps â€”
at least in my filter bubble. Web apps are typically continuously delivered, not rolled back,
 and you don't have to support multiple versions of the software running in the wild.

This is not the class of software that I had in mind when I wrote the blog post
10 years ago. If your team is doing continuous delivery of software, I would suggest to adopt a
much simpler workflow (like GitHub flow) instead of trying to shoehorn git-flow into your team.
